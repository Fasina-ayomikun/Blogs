## **Introduction**

**React** is a javascript library for building user interfaces easily and more effectively. It is nice to work with but without a good knowledge of javascript, it can become really hard to understand. Some developers including myself rushed into React just to find out that basic javascript knowledge is still very much needed, which is the main reason I am writing this to prevent you from making the same mistake we did.

## Am I ready to learn Reac**t?**

##### This is a question you should ask yourself if you are planning to go into React, but before answering this answer the questions below first.

1. ##### *Can you create a responsive website* *i.e a website that looks good on all media types?*
    
2. ##### *Can you write well-organized and well-structured Html and CSS code?*
    
3. ##### *Can you create a website with multiple pages?*
    
4. *Can you create a complete project by yourself without following tutorials?*
    
5. *Can you add simple Javascript functionalities to your projects e.g sidebar toggle, sticky navbar, modals, e.t.c*
    
6. *Do you understand Javascript Promises?*
    
7. *Do you know how to fetch data from an* ***API***?
    
8. *Do you know about the map, filter, find, and reduce methods?*
    
9. *Do you know about Array/Object destructuring and spread operators?*
    
10. *Do you know what* ***AJAX*** *is* *all about*?
    
    So after going through the questions do you still feel like you are ready for React? If so that's great and if you don't think so that is also alright. You don't have to know every single concept right now you will get to understand them more while working on the projects below.
    

## Prerequisites

* I would assume you already have a basic knowledge of Html, CSS and Javascript.
    

## Projects

### 1 . Sign-up/Login page

Creating a basic login or signup form will help you to improve your html and css skills. You will find it easier to work with some basic HTML tags like form, inputs, labels, textarea etc. You will also know more HTML attributes like the type, read-only, disabled, accept etc. Javascript is not needed in this project since it is focused on helping you improve your HTML and CSS skills.

### 2 . Landing Page

A landing page is one of the best projects used in practising designing and coding. It requires you to use your Html and Css knowledge to give a neat and well-structured design. What is probably going through your mind right now is how you will design a page but you don't have to design the page yourself just search online for websites and try to clone their landing page.

In the process of working on this project, you will be able to implement several CSS properties like color, lists, margins, paddings, animations, transitions etc. You will also learn more about Css units like px, rem, em etc. If you feel like challenging yourself even more you can add some basic javascript functionality like the sidebar toggle, sticky navbar, etc.

### 3\. A Portfolio Website

A portfolio website is a very common project to implement your html, css and javascript knowledge, it also helps you keep track of the projects you have worked on. This project is a little similar to a landing page but you can make it a little more complicated by adding more pages to the website. Feel free to add more functionalities to the project.

### 4\. A Simple Calculator

This project will help you to test your javascript knowledge and also challenge your problem-solving skills. While working on this project, you will be able to understand a few javascript terminologies like the if/else statement, for loop, while loop, functions, event listeners etc. It is a very nice project to work on to improve your basic javascript skills.

If you have no idea how to tackle this challenge you don't have to worry, I am here to help you and not to give you more problems. Here are links to some youtube videos to help you work on the project.

* [*Build A Calculator With JavaScript Tutorial by Web Dev Simplified*](https://youtu.be/j59qQ7YWLxw)
    
* [*How To Make A Calculator Using HTML CSS And JavaScript by Easy Tutorials*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGgLHJGyS34)
    

The best way to learn through tutorials is to either watch the video first and then start coding by yourself without the tutorial or to code along first and then work on it again on your own without the tutorial.

### 5\. A Stopwatch

A simple stopwatch is one of the most frequently heard javascript projects which is easy to implement and understand. It helps you to work with date and time and also some javascript methods like getTime, getMinutes, getSeconds, etc. You can challenge yourself by trying to work on the project, but If you don't know how to work on it, here are some youtube videos to guide you through.

* [*How To Create A Stopwatch Using JavaScript | Make Stopwatch With HTML, CSS And JavaScript by Easy Tutorials*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO-qjCC_UYQ)
    
* [*Learn HTML, CSS & JavaScript by coding a Stopwatch | A beginner tutorial by Tyler Potts*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49f1cjZWRJA)
    

Like I said previously do not get stuck in tutorial hell and try to work on the project yourself without the tutorial.

### 6 . A Quiz App

This is another interesting javascript project, it is a little bit more complicated than the other projects above and requires some javascript terminologies like if/else statements, for loops etc. You can decide to make it more complex by using an API which may require you to use your AJAX knowledge. An example of an API to use is [the trivial quiz api](https://the-trivia-api.com/), it gives you a lot of questions which can be filtered based on difficulty level, category, etc.

If you don't know how to work with APIS here are a few videos explaining the concept.

* [*Learn Fetch API in 6 minutes by Web Dev Simplified*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuEtnrL9-H0)
    
* [*How to use APIs by Code With Ania Kubow*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfaj4vI8QxE)
    

And If you don't know how to work on the project here are some videos explaining how to create a quiz app.

### 7\. A To-do List

A to-do list is a very common javascript project for beginners, it tests your javascript knowledge as well as your problem-solving skills. It can be created using different methods depending on how you want to approach it. You can decide to use the createAttribute method in javascript alongside inputs, or you can decide to use the map, filter and reduce methods. You can also decide to save your to-do lists on the browser using Local Storage in javascript. Feel free to use your method to solve the problem.

Here are some videos explaining different ways of creating this project:

* [*Build a Todo list app in HTML, CSS & JavaScript in 2021 by Tyler Potts*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkESyVB4oUw)
    
* [*Build a To-Do List in 20 MINUTES with JavaScript by dcode*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cijPd-TXPn4)
    
* [*Create A Todo List App in HTML CSS & JavaScript | Todo App in JavaScript by CodingNepal*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QIMUBilooc)
    

### 8\. Restaurant website

This project is a little different from the other projects above because it requires you to fully utilize your Html, CSS and Javascript knowledge to create a website with multiple pages. The website can be set up in a way that the menu's data is gotten locally but you can also decide to use an API e.g [spoonacular api](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).

Creating a website for a restaurant using pure html, css and javascript can be challenging but trust me if you can work on this project by yourself without coding along with a tutorial, you will be able to boost your confidence and knowledge in front-end development.

## Conclusion

The last thing I would love to tell you is to always challenge yourself and try your best to not get stuck in tutorial hell. Also, you have to remember to build a lot of projects using pure Javascript before going into a framework because a good foundation in Javascript will make your journey as a front-end developer less stressful and always put all your projects on [GitHub](https://www.github.com).
